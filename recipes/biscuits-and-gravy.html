    <h1>Biscuits and Gravy</h1>

    <p>There are two things to keep in mind when it comes to making your classic biscuits and gravy, you first need to
        make the biscuits which is the doughy bread, and the gravy which makes it all come together.
    </p>

    <h3>The following are the ingredients for the biscuits: </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking Powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Shortening</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make homemade biscuits: </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: 
            <p>Sift the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) into a large bowl.
                Cut the shortening, then add the milk. Mix until the dough is soft and doesn't stick to the side of the bowl
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Knead the dough:
            <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightlyfloured surface and knead briefly.
                Roll the dough into an even sheet that's about 1/2-inch thick.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Cut and bake:
            <p>Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the cut biscuits on an
                ungreased baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating the cutting process, until all the dough
                is gone. Bake in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F until golden brown.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Now the ingredients for the gravy: </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Sausage: You'll need a package of pork sausage.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour acts as a thickening agent.</li>
        <li>Milk: Milk adds richness and works with the flour to create the perfect texture.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: The gravy is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make the gravy: </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the biscuits.</li>
        <li>Cook the suasage.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, then stir in the milk and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce to a simmer and continue cooking for two minutes.</li>
        <li>Season to taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to serve: </h3>
    <p>Split the cooled biscuits in half, then ladle the gravy over the open biscuit halves.
        This stick-to-your-bones dish pairs perfectly with breakfast favorites, such as bacon and eggs.
        It is quite filling, though, so you might want to consider serving it with something light (like fresh fruit)
